Analyze the attached energy sales dataset to produce a CFO-ready report that highlights financial performance, operational efficiency, and strategic risks across energy segments and product lines. Specifically, I want you to:
1.	Segment Analysis: 
o	Compare total sales, average sale price, and profit across Solar, Wind, Hydro, Geothermal, and Biomass segments.
o	Identify which segments are driving revenue vs. profitability, and flag any segments operating at a loss.
2.	Product-Level Profitability: 
o	Rank products by total sales and profit contribution.
o	Highlight products with high unit volume but low margin, and any products with frequent losses.
3.	Monthly Trends & Seasonality: 
o	Visualize sales and profit trends by month and year.
o	Identify seasonal peaks and troughs, and correlate with unit volumes.
4.	Discount Impact: 
o	Quantify how discounting affects gross sales and net profit.
o	Flag any discount bands that consistently erode profitability.
5.	Outlier & Risk Detection: 
o	Surface transactions with unusually high or negative profit.
o	Identify patterns in loss-making deals (e.g., segment, product, pricing).
6.	Executive Summary: 
o	Provide a concise summary of key findings with actionable recommendations for improving margin, optimizing product mix, and reducing financial risk.
Use charts and tables where appropriate. Prioritize clarity, financial relevance, and strategic insight. This report will be used to inform FY26 planning and investment decisions.
