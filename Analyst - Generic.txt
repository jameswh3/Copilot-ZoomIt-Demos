What are some quick insights about the data from the uploaded file?[end]
What else should I know about the uploaded file?[end]
Now that you understand the data in the report better, I'd like you to help me write a prompt that will have a more impactful outcome. Give me an example of a detailed prompt the Analyst agent could use to generate an amazing report to help the <CUSTOMER_ROLE> gather meaningful insights from this data? Remember your job here is to understand the data plus the insights you've gleaned then write a detailed prompt that could have been used by a <CUSTOMER_ROLE> to generate a valuable report. Avoid the use of correlation matrices.[end]
Create a new chat and run the prompt above attaching the same file as before.[end]
