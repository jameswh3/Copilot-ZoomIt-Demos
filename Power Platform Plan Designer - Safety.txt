Build a safety management system that makes it easy for employees in the field to report safety incidents from their phones or computers. They should be able to enter details like where it happened, what type of injury or incident it was, which job site it occurred on, and attach photos if needed. On the back end, we want safety managers to be able to track these reports, look for trends by location or type of incident, assign follow-ups, and run reports to monitor safety performance. We also want to include a virtual assistant that employees can talk to in plain language to report incidents, ask for summaries of past incidents, or get answers to common safety questions based on our policies.[end]
